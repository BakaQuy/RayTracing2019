/*
 * Ray is the multi-traject class, it is simpler to use a complet class to follow the ray, it detains the \teta information as well as the total distance
 * The ray object gets after processing a set on points, on which all lines are drawn. It has one starting point, one point of segmentation.
 *
 * The rays will be put into two-dimentionnal arrays, the full path taken by light is one of those ray vectors, and all rays are the vector of those vectors.
 *
 * d ==  distance
 * teta == incidence angle
 * wallIbouncedOn == indice of the wall it has been reflected to.
